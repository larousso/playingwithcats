# Playing with cats 

Example of [cats mtl](https://github.com/typelevel/cats-mtl/blob/master/DESIGN.md) usage.

This repo show a mix of two nice conferences from [scalapeno](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiZ-yvcOuX76q5CpCW-9jHw) : 

 * FP event sourcing : [Traversals and Scans and CQRS, oh my! - Itamar Ravid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw0sGpp5TNA)
 * mtl usage and optilmisation : [A roadtrip with monads: from MTL, through tagless, to BIO - Paweł Szulc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM86Ab3lL20) 

The first implementation is taken ["Traversals and Scans and CQRS, oh my! - Itamar Ravid"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw0sGpp5TNA) and implemented with raw monad transformers.  

The second implementation is the same using cats mtl inspired by ["A roadtrip with monads: from MTL, through tagless, to BIO - Paweł Szulc"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM86Ab3lL20). 

The third is the second optimized with custom implementation of type classes also inspired by inspired by ["A roadtrip with monads: from MTL, through tagless, to BIO - Paweł Szulc"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM86Ab3lL20).
